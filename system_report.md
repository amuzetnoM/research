# System Report Log

## Project Structure and Architecture

This project is a modular AI research environment designed for advanced experimentation, monitoring, and self-improvement. It is structured into several layers, each with specific responsibilities and components. The layers are designed to be highly modular, allowing for independent development, testing, and deployment of individual components.

### Framework Layers and Interactions

The core of the system consists of the following layers:

1.  **Infrastructure & Orchestration:**
    *   **Description:** This layer provides the foundational infrastructure for the entire system. It includes tools and configurations for containerization, orchestration, and resource management.
    *   **Key Components:**
        *   **Docker and Docker Compose:** Used for creating and managing isolated containers for each service and component, ensuring consistency across different environments. Docker Compose defines the relationships and configurations between these containers.
        *   **Containerization:** Each major component of the system (monitoring, AI frameworks, state management, frontend) is packaged as a Docker container, allowing for easy deployment and scaling.
    *   **Interaction:** This layer is the base upon which all other layers are built. It ensures that all components can run consistently and communicate with each other.

2.  **Monitoring & Diagnostics:**
    *   **Description:** This layer is responsible for monitoring the health and performance of the system and providing diagnostic information for troubleshooting and optimization.
    *   **Key Components:**
        *   **Prometheus:** A time-series database that collects metrics from various system components and containers.
        *   **Grafana:** A visualization tool that creates dashboards to display the metrics collected by Prometheus, allowing for real-time monitoring of system performance.
        *   **Node Exporter & cAdvisor:** Prometheus exporters that collect system-level and container-level metrics (CPU, memory, disk usage, network activity, etc.).
        *   **Diagnostic Scripts:** Python, JavaScript, and Bash scripts that perform system sweeps, resource checks, and identify potential issues.
        *   **Error Handling:** A multi-layered error handling system (Bash, Python, JavaScript) with logging, retry mechanisms, and graceful degradation strategies.
    *   **Interaction:** This layer monitors the infrastructure layer and all subsequent layers. It provides feedback on their health and performance and enables proactive identification and resolution of issues.

3.  **AI Frameworks:**
    *   **Description:** This layer implements various AI frameworks, each responsible for a specific aspect of the system's cognitive capabilities.
    *   **Key Components:**
        *   **Self-Awareness Mechanics:** Tracks the system's self-introspection, capabilities, and awareness (epistemic, temporal, social).
        *   **COMPASS (Ethics Framework):** Provides ethical reasoning and governance for the system's actions.
        *   **Emotional Dimensionality:** Models and tracks "emotional" states of the system, allowing for adaptive control based on these states.
        *   **Cognitive Simulation:** Provides advanced reasoning and analytical capabilities.
        *   **Probabilistic Uncertainty Principle:** Manages uncertainty in AI systems
    *   **Interaction:** These frameworks interact with the state management layer to access and store information about the system's state and with the communication layer to receive inputs and provide outputs.

4.  **State Management:**
    *   **Description:** This layer manages the system's internal state, including data storage, retrieval, and querying capabilities.
    *   **Key Components:**
        *   **CNU (Core Neurological State Manager):** A centralized memory and query engine that integrates information from all frameworks and logs.
        *   **Memory Database:** Stores system data, logs, and states, providing a unified view of the system's knowledge and history.
        *   **Query Engine:** Allows for querying the system's memory, enabling frameworks and other components to retrieve relevant information.
        *   **Web3/NFT Integration:** Integrates with Web3 technologies and NFTs for decentralized and persistent memory storage.
    *   **Interaction:** This layer interacts with all AI frameworks to manage their data and state. It also provides data to the communication layer for external access.

5.  **Communication & APIs:**
    *   **Description:** This layer handles communication between different system components and external systems through standardized APIs.
    *   **Key Components:**
        *   **dataService Abstraction:** Provides a unified interface for different communication protocols (REST, SSE, WebSocket).
        *   **REST APIs:** For standard data requests and responses.
        *   **SSE (Server-Sent Events):** For real-time, unidirectional data updates from the server to clients.
        *   **WebSocket:** For bidirectional, real-time communication between clients and the server.
        *   **MCP (Context Protocol):** Manages context and session information, provides a unified interface for model providers, and exposes system information.
    *   **Interaction:** This layer facilitates communication between all other layers and provides interfaces for external access and control of the system.

6.  **Frontend Dashboard:**
    *   **Description:** This layer provides a user interface for monitoring and interacting with the system in real-time.
    *   **Key Components:**
        *   **React/TypeScript Dashboard:** A web-based interface that displays real-time environment monitoring data, metrics visualizations, and alerts.
        *   **Hooks and Services:** Abstractions (e.g., `useEnvironmentMonitoring`, `monitoringService`) that handle data fetching and protocol interactions.
        *   **UI Components:** Reusable components for displaying data, controls, and visualizations.
    *   **Interaction:** The frontend dashboard interacts with the communication layer to retrieve data from the system and provides a user-friendly interface for monitoring and controlling the system.
