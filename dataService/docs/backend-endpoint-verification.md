# Backend Endpoint Verification

This document confirms that all required backend endpoints have been implemented and tested with the frontend dataService abstraction.

## REST Endpoints

| Category | Endpoint | Method | Status | Notes |
|----------|----------|--------|--------|-------|
| Metrics | `/api/metrics` | GET | ✅ Working | Returns metrics data with optional time range parameter |
| Metrics | `/api/metrics/{containerId}` | GET | ✅ Working | Returns container-specific metrics |
| Dashboard | `/api/dashboards` | GET | ✅ Working | Lists all available dashboards |
| Dashboard | `/api/dashboards/{id}` | GET | ✅ Working | Returns specific dashboard configuration |
| Widget | `/api/widgets/{id}` | GET | ✅ Working | Returns widget data |
| Widget | `/api/widgets/{id}` | PUT | ✅ Working | Updates widget configuration |
| Monitoring | `/api/monitoring/health` | GET | ✅ Working | Returns system health status |
| Monitoring | `/api/monitoring/alerts` | GET | ✅ Working | Lists active system alerts |
| Monitoring | `/api/monitoring/performance` | GET | ✅ Working | Returns system performance data |

## Server-Sent Events (SSE) Endpoints

| Category | Endpoint | Status | Notes |
|----------|----------|--------|-------|
| Metrics | `/api/metrics/stream` | ✅ Working | Streams real-time metrics updates |
| Alerts | `/api/alerts/stream` | ✅ Working | Streams real-time alert notifications |
| System | `/api/system/events` | ✅ Working | Streams system events and status changes |

## Context Protocol (MCP) Endpoints

| Category | Endpoint | Method | Status | Notes |
|----------|----------|--------|-------|-------|
| Session | `/api/v1/session` | POST | ✅ Working | Creates a new session |
| Session | `/api/v1/session/{session_id}` | GET | ✅ Working | Retrieves session information |
| Session | `/api/v1/session/{session_id}` | DELETE | ✅ Working | Deletes a session |
| Model | `/api/v1/session/{session_id}/chat` | POST | ✅ Working | Sends chat message to model |
| Model | `/api/v1/session/{session_id}/completion` | POST | ✅ Working | Gets model completion |
| Model | `/api/v1/session/{session_id}/embedding` | POST | ✅ Working | Generates embeddings |
| System | `/api/v1/models` | GET | ✅ Working | Lists available models |
| System | `/api/v1/status` | GET | ✅ Working | Gets server status information |
| System | `/api/v1/health` | GET | ✅ Working | Simple health check endpoint |
| System | `/metrics` | GET | ✅ Working | Prometheus metrics endpoint |

## Integration Testing

All endpoints have been tested with the dataService abstraction with the following validation methods:

1. **Functionality Testing**: Each endpoint correctly processes requests and returns expected responses
2. **Error Handling**: Error responses follow a standardized format and provide useful information
3. **Performance Testing**: Response times meet requirements under normal load conditions
4. **Caching**: TTL-based caching works correctly for read-only endpoints
5. **Protocol Support**: Endpoints support the appropriate protocols (REST/SSE)

## Error Handling and Logging

All backend endpoints implement consistent error handling with the following features:

1. **Standardized Error Responses**:
   ```json
   {
     "status": "error",
     "error": {
       "code": "ERROR_CODE",
       "message": "Human-readable error message",
       "details": { /* Additional context for debugging */ }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Proper HTTP Status Codes**:
   - 400: Bad Request - Invalid parameters
   - 401: Unauthorized - Authentication required
   - 403: Forbidden - Permission denied
   - 404: Not Found - Resource doesn't exist
   - 429: Too Many Requests - Rate limiting
   - 500: Internal Server Error - Server-side issue

3. **Comprehensive Logging**:
   - Request information (path, method, client IP)
   - Error details and stack traces
   - Performance metrics for debugging
   - User/session context for traceability

## Notes and Recommendations

1. Consider adding more granular endpoints for specific metrics to reduce payload size
2. Implement WebSocket support for collaborative features in the future
3. Add support for batch operations to reduce API calls for dashboard initialization
