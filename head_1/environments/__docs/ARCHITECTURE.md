Core ComponentsSimulationManager:Orchestrates the simulation execution.Manages the game loop.Updates the environment and entities.Calculates and stores global metrics.Environment:Represents the simulated world.Contains the grid structure.Manages resources, obstacles, and rewards.Handles environmental dynamics.ArtificialLifeform:Represents a simulated lifeform.Contains energy, sensors, and behaviors.Interacts with the environment.Updates its state based on environmental stimuli.Behaviors:Defines the actions an artificial lifeform can perform.Encapsulates the logic for decision-making and action execution.Sensors:Provides the artificial lifeform with information about its surroundings.Abstracts the perception of the environment.Event Log:Records significant events that occur during the simulation.Provides a history of the simulation.Global Metrics:Tracks simulation-wide performance data.Provides insights into the overall state of the simulation.Data FlowThe SimulationManager starts the simulation loop.In each iteration:The Environment updates its state.Each ArtificialLifeform uses its Sensors to perceive the environment.Based on the sensory input, the ArtificialLifeform selects a Behavior to execute.The ArtificialLifeform executes the chosen Behavior, which may affect its energy level and the environment.The SimulationManager updates Global Metrics.Significant events are recorded in the Event Log.The loop continues until the specified number of iterations is reached or the simulation is stopped.Key PrinciplesModularity: The system is composed of loosely coupled components, making it easier to modify and extend.Abstraction: Components interact through well-defined interfaces, hiding the internal implementation details.Flexibility: The architecture supports various complexity levels and can be adapted to different simulation scenarios.Scalability: The design can handle a large number of entities and a complex environment.Robustness: The system is designed to prevent logical failures and ensure continuous operation.
