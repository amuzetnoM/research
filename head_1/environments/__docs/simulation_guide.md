Setup and Usage Guide1. InstallationSince the simulation environment is designed to be self-contained, you primarily need Python 3.x installed.  Here's a basic setup:Clone the repository (if applicable): If you have access to the code in a repository (e.g., GitHub), clone it to your local machine:git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_directory>
Ensure Python 3.x is installed: The environment requires Python 3.x. You can check your Python version by running:python --version
If Python 3.x is not installed, download and install it from python.org.Dependencies (If any): If the environment has any external dependencies, they can be installed using pip.  A requirements.txt file is commonly used to manage dependencies.  If provided, install them using:pip install -r requirements.txt
If there is no requirements.txt file, you can ignore this step.2. Basic UsageHere's how to use the simulation environment:Import the necessary classes:from simulation_environment import SimulationEnvironment
from entities import SimpleEntity  # Import your entity classes
import random # Import the random module
Initialize the environment:Create an instance of the SimulationEnvironment class to set up the simulation.Specify the size of the environment, initial resources, and complexity level.env = SimulationEnvironment(size=(50, 50), initial_resources=1000, complexity_level="medium", name="MySimulation")
Create and add entities:Create instances of your entity classes (e.g., SimpleEntity).Add the entities to the environment using the add_entity() method.for i in range(10):
    x = random.randrange(50)  # Use random.randrange
    y = random.randrange(50)
    entity = SimpleEntity(id=f"entity_{i}", x=x, y=y, energy=100)
    env.add_entity(entity)
Run the simulation:Call the run_simulation() method to start the simulation.Specify the number of iterations and the time step.env.run_simulation(num_iterations=1000, time_step=0.1)
Access simulation data:Use the environment's methods to retrieve data, such as global metrics, the grid state, and the event log.global_metrics = env.get_global_metrics()
print("Global Metrics:", global_metrics)

grid_state = env.get_grid_state()
print("Grid State:", grid_state)

event_log = env.get_event_log()
print("Event Log:", event_log)
3. Key Class: SimulationEnvironmentThe main class for managing the simulation.class SimulationEnvironment:
    def __init__(self, size=(100, 100), initial_resources=1000, complexity_level="medium", name="Alife_Simulation"):
        # Initializes the simulation environment.
        # size: The dimensions of the environment (width, height).
        # initial_resources: The starting amount of resources.
        # complexity_level: "basic", "medium", or "advanced".
        # name: Name of the simulation.
    def run_simulation(self, num_iterations=1000, time_step=0.1):
        # Runs the simulation for a specified number of iterations.
        # num_iterations: The number of iterations to run.
        # time_step: The time increment for each iteration.
    def add_entity(self, entity):
        # Adds an entity to the simulation environment.
    def remove_entity(self, entity_id):
        # Removes an entity from the simulation environment.
    def get_entity_position(self, entity_id):
        # Retrieves the position of an entity.
    def move_entity(self, entity_id, new_x, new_y):
        # Moves an entity to a new location.
    def get_neighbors(self, x, y, radius=1):
        # Retrieves neighboring entities within a radius.
    def get_resource_amount(self):
        # Retrieves the current amount of resources.
    def consume_resources(self, amount):
        # Consumes resources from the environment.
    def replenish_resources(self):
        # Replenishes resources in the environment.
    def update_global_metrics(self):
        # Updates global metrics for the simulation.
    def introduce_dynamic_events(self):
        # Introduces random dynamic events.
    def get_grid_state(self):
       # Returns the current state of the grid.
    def get_global_metrics(self):
        # Returns the global metrics.
    def get_event_log(self):
        # Returns the event log.
    def add_program(self, program_name, program_instance):
        # Adds a program to the simulation.
    def get_program(self, program_name):
        # Retrieves a program from the simulation.
    def remove_program(self, program_name):
        # Removes a program from the simulation.
    def run_program(self, program_name, *args, **kwargs):
        # Runs a program within the simulation.
    def stop_simulation(self):
        # Stops the simulation.
    def update_environment(self):
        #Updates the environment
    def __str__(self):
        #Returns string representation
    def __repr__(self):
       #Official string representation
4.  Entity CreationYou'll need to define classes for your artificial lifeform entities.  These classes should inherit from a base entity class (e.g., BaseEntity) and implement the specific behavior, sensors, and energy management for your simulation.5.  Running Multiple ProgramsThe simulation environment supports running multiple programs concurrently.  This can be useful for simulating interactions between different systems or agents.  Use the add_program() and run_program() methods to manage and execute programs within the simulation.6.  CustomizationThe simulation environment is highly customizable:Environment Dynamics: Modify the update_environment() method to change how the environment evolves.Entity Behavior: Create custom entity classes with unique behaviors and interactions.Metrics: Add or modify the global metrics tracked by the simulation.Events: Customize the dynamic events that occur in the simulation.
