# Context Protocol Architecture

## System Architecture

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) system follows a client-server architecture designed for scalability, extensibility, and maintainability. This document outlines the high-level architecture and design principles.

## Core Components

### Server Components

1. **UnifiedMCPServer** - The central server component that handles client requests
   - Routes HTTP requests to appropriate handlers
   - Manages CORS and middleware
   - Coordinates between other components

2. **MCPSessionManager** - Manages stateful sessions
   - Creates and tracks user sessions
   - Handles session expiration and cleanup
   - Maintains conversational context

3. **Model Providers** - Adapters for various AI model providers
   - OpenAI Provider (`openai_provider.py`)
   - HuggingFace Provider (`huggingface_provider.py`)
   - Custom providers can be added

4. **Monitoring System** - Prometheus metrics and health checks
   - Request counts and latencies
   - Memory and resource usage
   - Model token usage

### Client Components

1. **MCPClient** - Asynchronous client for interacting with the MCP server
   - Session management
   - Model interaction (chat, completion, embedding)
   - Context handling

2. **MCPSyncClient** - Synchronous wrapper around the async client
   - Provides a blocking interface for synchronous code
   - Internally manages async event loops

### Data Models

1. **MCPSession** - Represents a stateful context-aware session
   - Unique session ID
   - Context storage
   - History tracking
   - Metadata

2. **Request/Response Models** - Structured data formats
   - Chat requests/responses
   - Completion requests/responses
   - Embedding requests/responses

## Communication Flow

1. **Client Initiates Session**
   - Client creates a session via the API
   - Server generates a session ID and initializes context

2. **Model Interaction**
   - Client sends requests with the session ID
   - Server retrieves session context
   - Server routes request to appropriate model provider
   - Model provider generates response
   - Server updates session context with results
   - Response returned to client

3. **Session Management**
   - Sessions expire after configurable TTL
   - Background task cleans up expired sessions
   - Clients can explicitly delete sessions

## Design Principles

### 1. Stateful Context Management

MCP maintains context across interactions, enabling more natural conversations and complex reasoning chains. The stateful design allows for:

- Memory of previous interactions
- Building cumulative context
- Long-running reasoning processes

### 2. Provider Abstraction

The system abstracts away the differences between model providers through a common interface. This enables:

- Swapping model providers without code changes
- Combining multiple providers in the same application
- Graceful fallbacks between providers

### 3. Extensibility

MCP is designed to be extended with new capabilities:

- Custom model providers can be added through the provider interface
- Additional endpoints can be introduced to the server
- The session model can be extended with new context types

### 4. Observability

Comprehensive metrics and logging provide visibility into the system:

- Prometheus metrics for key performance indicators
- Structured logging for debugging
- Health check endpoints for monitoring

## Security Considerations

- **Authentication**: Server implementations can add authentication middleware
- **Session Isolation**: Sessions are isolated from each other
- **API Key Management**: Provider API keys are handled securely
- **CORS Configuration**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing is configurable

## Performance Optimizations

- **Connection Pooling**: Shared HTTP client sessions
- **Session Expiration**: Automatic cleanup of unused sessions
- **Lazy Loading**: Providers are loaded on demand
- **Async Design**: Non-blocking I/O for high throughput

## Integration Points

MCP is designed to integrate with existing systems:

- **Web Servers**: Integration templates for aiohttp, Flask, and FastAPI
- **Monitoring Systems**: Prometheus metrics endpoint
- **Model Providers**: Extensible provider system
- **Application Code**: Simple client library for integration
