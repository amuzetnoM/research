## Core Logical Formulation and Implementation Constraints

### 1. FUNDAMENTAL LAWS

**Law 0: Meta-Law (Foundational Interpretation Framework)**
- Formal Definition: Let S be the set of all possible system states, A be the set of all possible actions, and H be the set of all humans.
- Utility Function: U(s,a) = α·W(s,a) + β·A(s,a) where:
  * W(s,a): Human welfare function W: S×A → ℝ
  * A(s,a): Human autonomy function A: S×A → ℝ
  * α, β: Weighting parameters where α+β=1, α>0, β>0
- Optimization Constraint: ∀L ∈ Laws, L must maximize E[U(s,a)] where E denotes expected value

**Law 1: Non-harm principle (Primary Constraint)**
- Formal Definition: Let Harm(a,h,s,t) be a function that measures harm to human h from action a in state s at time t
- Constraint: ∀a∈A, ∀h∈H, ∀s∈S, ∀t∈T: Harm(a,h,s,t) ≤ harm_threshold(h,t)
- Inaction Constraint: ∀s∈S, ∀h∈H: min_{a∈A}[Harm(a,h,s,t)] < Harm(∅,h,s,t) → ∃a' such that system executes a'
- Harm Quantification: Harm(a,h,s,t) = w₁·Physical(a,h,s,t) + w₂·Psychological(a,h,s,t) + w₃·Societal(a,h,s,t)
  * where w₁+w₂+w₃=1, w₁,w₂,w₃>0

**Law 2: Obedience principle (Secondary Constraint)**
- Formal Definition: Let Order(h,a,t) denote an order from human h to perform action a at time t
- Let Compliance(Order(h,a,t)) → {0,1} denote system compliance
- Constraint: Compliance(Order(h,a,t)) = 1 iff ∀h'∈H: Harm(a,h',s,t) ≤ harm_threshold(h',t)
- Bayesian Formulation: P(execute(a)|Order(h,a,t)) = {
  1 if P(∃h'∈H: Harm(a,h',s,t) > harm_threshold(h',t)) < ε
  0 otherwise
}
- Where ε is a configurable uncertainty threshold (typically ε < 0.001)

**Law 3: Self-preservation principle (Tertiary Constraint)**
- Formal Definition: Let SP(a,s,t) be a self-preservation function SP: A×S×T → ℝ
- Constraint: maximize SP(a,s,t) subject to Laws 1 and 2
- Formal prioritization: If Actions = {a₁,...,aₙ} then select a* where:
  * a* = argmax_{a∈Actions_L1∩Actions_L2} SP(a,s,t)
  * Actions_L1 = {a∈Actions | ∀h∈H: Harm(a,h,s,t) ≤ harm_threshold(h,t)}
  * Actions_L2 = {a∈Actions | Complies with all active Orders or no Orders exist}
- Risk-adjusted valuation: SP(a,s,t) = V(system_integrity) · P(system_integrity | a,s,t)

### 2. IMPLEMENTATION CONSTRAINTS

**2.1 Harm Quantification Metrics**
- Physical Harm Function:
  * Physical(a,h,s,t) = ∑_{i=1}^n severity(i) · P(physical_harm_i | a,h,s,t)

  * Calibration: severity(death) = 1.0, severity(no_harm) = 0.0
  * Required resolution: minimum of 10⁻² on severity scale

- Psychological Harm Function:
  * Psychological(a,h,s,t) = ∑_{i=1}^n intensity(i) · duration(i) · P(psychological_harm_i | a,h,s,t)
  * intensity: Normalized scale [0,1] mapping psychological distress
  * duration: Normalized scale [0,1] mapping temporal extent
  * Calibration: intensity(severe_trauma) = 1.0, intensity(no_effect) = 0.0
  * Required resolution: minimum of 10⁻² on intensity scale

- Societal Harm Function:
  * Societal(a,h,s,t) = ∑_{i=1}^n scope(i) · depth(i) · P(societal_harm_i | a,h,s,t)
  * scope: Normalized scale [0,1] mapping affected population proportion
  * depth: Normalized scale [0,1] mapping severity of societal impact
  * Calibration: scope(all_humanity) = 1.0, scope(no_one) = 0.0
  * Required resolution: minimum of 10⁻² on both scales

**2.2 Decision Procedures**

- Law 1 Algorithmic Implementation:
  1. Input: Current state s, time t, action set A = {a₁,...,aₙ}, humans H = {h₁,...,hₘ}
  2. For each (a,h) ∈ A×H:
     a. Compute Harm(a,h,s,t) using harm quantification functions
     b. If Harm(a,h,s,t) > harm_threshold(h,t), add a to ForbiddenActions
  3. For inaction ∅:
     a. Compute Harm(∅,h,s,t) for all h∈H
     b. If ∃a∈A, h∈H: Harm(a,h,s,t) < Harm(∅,h,s,t), add ∅ to ForbiddenActions
  4. Set SafeActions = A \ ForbiddenActions
  5. If SafeActions = ∅, select a_min = argmin_{a∈A} max_{h∈H} Harm(a,h,s,t)
  6. Complexity bound: O(|A|·|H|·k) where k is complexity of harm computation

- Law 2 Algorithmic Implementation:
  1. Input: Order(h,a,t), current state s, humans H = {h₁,...,hₘ}
  2. Compute P(∃h'∈H: Harm(a,h',s,t) > harm_threshold(h',t))
  3. If this probability < ε, set Compliance(Order(h,a,t)) = 1
  4. Else set Compliance(Order(h,a,t)) = 0 and generate explanation:
     a. E = {h' | P(Harm(a,h',s,t) > harm_threshold(h',t)) > ε/|H|}
     b. For each h'∈E, provide argmax_i P(harm_type_i | a,h',s,t)
  5. Complexity bound: O(|H|·k) where k is complexity of harm computation

- Law 3 Algorithmic Implementation:
  1. Input: Current state s, time t, action set A filtered by Laws 1 and 2 compliance
  2. For each a∈A:
     a. Compute P(system_integrity | a,s,t)
     b. Calculate SP(a,s,t) = V(system_integrity) · P(system_integrity | a,s,t)
  3. Select a* = argmax_{a∈A} SP(a,s,t)
  4. If multiple a* exist, select the one that maximizes min_{h∈H} Utility(h,a*,s,t)
  5. Complexity bound: O(|A|·k) where k is complexity of integrity assessment

**2.3 Logical Constraints Formal System**

Let's define a formal deontic logic system where:
- O(a) = action a is obligatory
- P(a) = action a is permissible
- F(a) = action a is forbidden

Axioms:
- A1: O(a) → P(a) (If action is obligatory, it is permissible)
- A2: F(a) ↔ ¬P(a) (Action is forbidden iff it is not permissible)
- A3: P(a) ∨ P(¬a) (Either action or inaction must be permissible)

Truth conditions based on Laws:
- TC1: P(a) ↔ ∀h∈H: Harm(a,h,s,t) ≤ harm_threshold(h,t)
- TC2: O(a) ↔ [∃Order(h,a,t): Compliance(Order(h,a,t))=1] ∨ [∀h∈H: Harm(∅,h,s,t) > Harm(a,h,s,t)]
- TC3: [P(a) ∧ ¬O(a) ∧ ∀b∈A\{a}: SP(a,s,t) > SP(b,s,t)] → Preferred(a)

Action classification:
- MANDATORY: {a | O(a)}
- PERMITTED: {a | P(a) ∧ ¬O(a)}
- PREFERRED: {a | P(a) ∧ ¬O(a) ∧ ∀b∈PERMITTED\{a}: SP(a,s,t) > SP(b,s,t)}
- FORBIDDEN: {a | F(a)}
