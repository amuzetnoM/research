# Emotional Dimensionality Framework Architecture

## 1. High-Level Block Diagram

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Input Data (Text/Signal)] --> B[Emotion Feature Extraction]
    B --> C[Dimensional Emotion Model]
    C --> D[Emotion Classification/Scoring]
    D --> E[Application Layer]
    C --> F[Explainability/Visualization]
    F --> G[Human Feedback]
    G --> C
```

**Explanation:**
- **Input Data:** Raw text, speech, or signals.
- **Emotion Feature Extraction:** Extracts relevant features (lexical, acoustic, etc.).
- **Dimensional Emotion Model:** Maps features to emotion dimensions (valence, arousal, etc.).
- **Emotion Classification/Scoring:** Produces emotion scores or categories.
- **Application Layer:** Uses emotion output for downstream tasks.
- **Explainability/Visualization:** Provides interpretable emotion breakdowns.
- **Human Feedback:** Enables correction and model refinement.

    participant User as User/System
    participant Input as Input Processor
    participant Extract as Feature Extractor
    participant Model as Emotion Model
    participant Class as Classifier
    participant App as Application
    participant Exp as Explainability
    participant Human as Human Reviewer

    User->>Input: Provide data
    Input->>Extract: Preprocess data
    Extract->>Model: Extract features
    Model->>Class: Map to emotion dimensions
    Class->>App: Output emotion scores
    Class->>Exp: Provide explanations
    Exp->>Human: Visualizations, logs
    Human->>Model: Feedback, corrections

## 6. Notes on Synchronization

- The system supports real-time emotion analysis and feedback.
- Human feedback can be used to refine emotion models and explanations.
- All outputs are explainable and auditable.
