# Self-Awareness Framework Architecture

This document outlines the architecture and design principles of the Self-Awareness Framework.

## System Overview

The Self-Awareness Framework enables AI systems running in Docker containers to develop enhanced introspective capabilities with minimal configuration. It is designed for autonomous operation, requiring no further interaction once connected.

## Components

### 1. Self-Awareness Server

The central component that manages connections from multiple AI clients and provides:

- Connection management
- Centralized analysis of metrics
- Insights generation
- Alert propagation

### 2. Self-Awareness Client

A lightweight client library that AI systems can integrate to:

- Connect to the self-awareness server
- Collect and transmit system metrics
- Receive insights and alerts
- Query system status

### 3. Example AI Agent

A demonstration AI agent that shows how to:

- Integrate with the self-awareness client
- Handle insights and alerts
- Report decision-making metrics
- Adjust behavior based on self-awareness information

## Data Flow

1. **Metric Collection**:
   - Clients collect metrics about their operation
   - Metrics are sent to the server at adaptive intervals

2. **Analysis**:
   - Server analyzes metrics from individual clients
   - Patterns and anomalies are identified

3. **Insight Generation**:
   - Server generates insights based on analysis
   - Insights are sent back to the client

4. **Behavioral Adaptation**:
   - Client receives insights and alerts
   - AI system adjusts behavior based on self-awareness

## Key Features

### Automatic Lifecycle Management

- **Zero-configuration setup**: The client automatically connects to the server
- **Graceful disconnection**: Resources are cleaned up when a client disconnects
- **Auto-reconnection**: Client attempts to reconnect if the connection is lost

### Adaptive Monitoring

- Monitoring frequency adjusts based on system load
- More frequent updates when anomalies are detected
- Resource usage optimized during idle periods

### Autonomous Operation

The framework operates without requiring additional instructions by:

1. Automatically collecting relevant metrics
2. Identifying patterns and anomalies without configuration
3. Generating actionable insights
4. Providing appropriate alerts when intervention is needed

## Extending the Framework

The framework can be extended in several ways:

1. **Additional Metrics**: Add new metrics to the client for collection
2. **Custom Analysis**: Implement specialized analysis algorithms in the server
3. **New Insight Types**: Define new categories of insights
4. **Integration with Other Systems**: Connect with monitoring or logging systems

## Implementation Notes

- **Websockets**: Used for bidirectional communication
- **Asynchronous Design**: All components use async/await for efficient operation
- **Task-based Architecture**: Separate tasks for different monitoring functions
- **Adaptive Behavior**: Components adjust behavior based on runtime conditions
