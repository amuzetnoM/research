"""
This module provides core functionalities for temporal awareness, including handling time units,
understanding past-present-future relationships, and anticipating future events.

Core Features:
    - Time Unit Handling: Conversion between different time units (seconds, minutes, hours, days).
    - Historical Analysis: Assessment of past actions' impacts.
    - Future Prediction: Anticipation of future outcomes.
    - Current Time: Obtain the current timestamp.

Usage:
    This module is intended to be integrated into larger frameworks that require
    temporal reasoning and understanding, such as the Temporal Locationing Framework.
