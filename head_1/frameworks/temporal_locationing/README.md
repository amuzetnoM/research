# Temporal Locationing Framework

## Overview

The Temporal Locationing Framework is designed to provide advanced temporal awareness capabilities to AI systems. This framework enables the AI to understand the concept of time, including the past, present, and future. It allows the AI to reason about time-dependent events, understand the sequence of actions, anticipate future states, and learn from past experiences. By integrating this framework, AI systems can make more informed decisions, adapt to dynamic environments, and plan effectively.

## Purpose

The primary purposes of the Temporal Locationing Framework are to:

*   **Provide Time Awareness:** Enable the AI to understand and reason about time.
*   **Understand Temporal Relationships:** Allow the AI to comprehend how events are ordered in time and how they relate to each other.
*   **Anticipate the Future:** Enable the AI to predict future states and the consequences of actions.
*   **Learn from the Past:** Facilitate the AI's ability to analyze past events and use this knowledge to inform future decisions.
*   **Enhance Decision Making:** Improve the AI's decision-making process by considering the temporal context of situations.

## Usage

The Temporal Locationing Framework can be used by initializing the `TemporalLocationingFramework` class and then using its various methods to interact with time-related information.

### Example
```
python
from head_1.frameworks.temporal_locationing.temporal_locationing_framework import TemporalLocationingFramework
import datetime

# Initialize the framework
temporal_framework = TemporalLocationingFramework()

# Get the current time
current_time = temporal_framework.get_current_time()
print(f"Current time: {current_time}")

# Analyze a past event
past_event_time = datetime.datetime(2023, 1, 1, 10, 0, 0)
past_event_description = "System initialization"
temporal_framework.analyze_past_event(past_event_time, past_event_description)

# Plan future actions
future_action_time = datetime.datetime.now() + datetime.timedelta(days=1)
future_action_description = "System maintenance"
temporal_framework.plan_future_action(future_action_time, future_action_description)

# Get future actions
future_actions = temporal_framework.get_future_actions()
for action in future_actions:
    print(f"Planned future action: {action}")

# Determine if an action will affect the future
action = "System reset"
will_affect_future = temporal_framework.will_action_affect_future(action)
print(f"Will the action '{action}' affect the future? {will_affect_future}")

# Get the current context
current_context = temporal_framework.get_current_context()
print(f"Current context: {current_context}")

# Get time units
time_units = temporal_framework.get_time_units()
print(f"Time units: {time_units}")
```
## Functions

The Temporal Locationing Framework includes the following functions:

*   **`get_current_time()`**: Returns the current time.
*   **`analyze_past_event(event_time, event_description)`**: Analyzes a past event, taking the time and a description of the event.
*   **`plan_future_action(action_time, action_description)`**: Plans a future action, taking the time and a description of the action.
*   **`get_future_actions()`**: Returns a list of planned future actions.
*   **`will_action_affect_future(action)`**: Determines if a specific action will likely affect the future.
*   **`get_current_context()`**: Returns the current temporal context.
*   **`get_time_units()`**: Returns all time units.

## Setup

To use the Temporal Locationing Framework:

1.  **Ensure Dependencies:** Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed.
    *You must have all dependencies installed on the `setup/requirements.txt` file.*
2.  **Import the Framework:** In your Python code, import the framework:
```
python
    from head_1.frameworks.temporal_locationing.temporal_locationing_framework import TemporalLocationingFramework
    
```
3.  **Initialize:** Initialize the framework by creating an instance of the `TemporalLocationingFramework` class:
```
python
    temporal_framework = TemporalLocationingFramework()
    
```
4. **Use functions:** You can now use all the framework functions.
