# Probabilistic Uncertainty Principle (PUP) Framework Architecture

## 1. High-Level Block Diagram

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Input/Observation] --> B[Belief State Representation]
    B --> C[Uncertainty Propagation]
    C --> D[Confidence-Based Execution]
    D --> E[Action/Decision]
    C --> F[Explainability/Calibration]
    F --> G[Human Feedback]
    G --> B
```

**Explanation:**
- **Input/Observation:** Raw data or system state.
- **Belief State Representation:** Encodes mean, variance, and confidence.
- **Uncertainty Propagation:** Updates beliefs through transformations.
- **Confidence-Based Execution:** Gates actions based on confidence thresholds.
- **Action/Decision:** Executes or defers actions.
- **Explainability/Calibration:** Provides confidence/explanation outputs.
- **Human Feedback:** Refines thresholds and calibration.

## 6. Notes on Synchronization

- All components operate in a real-time, uncertainty-aware loop.
- Human feedback is used for calibration and threshold adjustment.
- All decisions are explainable and confidence-annotated.
