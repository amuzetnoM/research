# Social Dimensionality Framework Architecture

## Overview

The Social Dimensionality Framework is designed to enable our AI systems to understand and navigate the complexities of social interactions. It provides a structured way to analyze, interpret, and respond to social cues, emotional contexts, and the roles of different agents within a given interaction. This document outlines the framework's architecture, core components, and their interactions.

## Design Principles

The framework is built upon the following principles:

*   **Contextual Awareness:** Social interactions are heavily influenced by context. The framework must capture and leverage various contextual factors.
*   **Emotional Nuance:** Emotions play a critical role in social dynamics. The framework must be able to analyze and understand a spectrum of emotions beyond simple positivity or negativity.
*   **Agent Roles:** Social interactions are defined by the roles that agents play. The framework must identify and track these roles.
*   **Interaction Dynamics:** Interactions are dynamic and evolve over time. The framework must be capable of capturing and understanding these changes.
*   **Data-Driven:** The framework relies on data structures that can represent complex relationships and contextual information.

## Core Components

The Social Dimensionality Framework is composed of the following modules:

1.  **Interaction Tracker:** This module is responsible for detecting, recording, and managing social interactions.
2.  **Emotion Analyzer:** This module analyzes the emotional context of interactions, identifying and classifying the emotions of different agents.
3.  **Context Manager:** This module handles various contextual factors that influence interactions.
4.  **Role Identifier:** This module determines the roles of agents within an interaction.
5.  **Memory Manager:** This module stores and retrieves historical interaction data.

## Module Interactions and Logic

### 1. Interaction Tracker

*   **Purpose:** To identify and track social interactions as they occur.
*   **Logic:**
    *   Monitors incoming data streams for signs of social interaction (e.g., communication, actions affecting other agents).
    *   Initiates the creation of an `Interaction` object when an interaction is detected.
    *   Maintains a record of ongoing and completed interactions.
    *   Passes the interaction to be analyzed by the other modules.
*   **Interactions:**
    *   Sends `Interaction` objects to the `Emotion Analyzer`, `Context Manager`, and `Role Identifier`.
    *   Sends completed `Interaction` objects to the `Memory Manager`.

### 2. Emotion Analyzer

*   **Purpose:** To identify and analyze the emotions expressed within an interaction.
*   **Logic:**
    *   Receives an `Interaction` object from the `Interaction Tracker`.
    *   Applies sentiment analysis techniques to the interaction data.
    *   Determines the valence, arousal, and dominance of emotions (using the Emotional Dimensionality Framework).
    *   Identifies the emotions of each participant.
    *   Updates the `Interaction` object with the results.
*   **Interactions:**
    *   Receives `Interaction` objects from the `Interaction Tracker`.
    *   Updates `Interaction` objects with emotional data.

### 3. Context Manager

*   **Purpose:** To identify and manage the various contextual factors that influence an interaction.
*   **Logic:**
    *   Receives an `Interaction` object from the `Interaction Tracker`.
    *   Identifies relevant contextual factors (e.g., location, time, previous interactions, external events).
    *   Adds contextual information to the `Interaction` object.
*   **Interactions:**
    *   Receives `Interaction` objects from the `Interaction Tracker`.
    *   Updates `Interaction` objects with contextual information.

### 4. Role Identifier

*   **Purpose:** To determine the roles of the AI and other agents within an interaction.
*   **Logic:**
    *   Receives an `Interaction` object from the `Interaction Tracker`.
    *   Analyzes the interaction data and contextual factors to determine the roles of each agent (e.g., leader, follower, collaborator, competitor).
    *   Updates the `Interaction` object with the identified roles.
*   **Interactions:**
    *   Receives `Interaction` objects from the `Interaction Tracker`.
    *   Updates `Interaction` objects with agent role data.

### 5. Memory Manager

*   **Purpose:** To store and retrieve historical interaction data.
*   **Logic:**
    *   Receives completed `Interaction` objects.
    *   Stores interaction data in a structured format.
    *   Allows for querying and retrieving past interactions based on various criteria (e.g., agent, context, emotion, time).
*   **Interactions:**
    *   Receives completed `Interaction` objects from the `Interaction Tracker`.
    *   Provides data to the `Context Manager` to help establish context.

## Data Structures

The framework relies on the following core data structures:

*   **Interaction:** Represents a social interaction and contains:
    *   `interaction_id`: Unique identifier.
    *   `timestamp`: Start time of the interaction.
    *   `participants`: List of participants.
    *   `emotions`: Dictionary mapping agents to emotions.
    *   `context`: Dictionary of contextual data.
    *   `roles`: Dictionary mapping agents to roles.
    * `raw_data`: all incoming data and all responses.

*   **Agent:** Represents an agent involved in the interaction and contains:
    *   `agent_id`: Unique identifier.
    *   `name`: Agent name.
    * `agent_type`: Type of agent

*   **Emotion:** Represents an emotion and contains:
    *   `valence`: Emotional positivity/negativity.
    *   `arousal`: Emotional intensity.
    *   `dominance`: Feeling of control.
    * `emotion_type`: Specific emotion type.
    * `confidence`: Level of certainty of emotions

* **Context:**  Contains specific context.
    * `context_type`: Type of context
    * `context_data`: The contextual data

## Conclusion

The Social Dimensionality Framework provides a robust and flexible architecture for understanding social interactions. Its modular design allows for extensibility and adaptation to different types of agents and social scenarios. The use of specialized modules and data structures ensures that the framework can capture and interpret the nuances of social dynamics effectively.
