# COMPASS Framework: Architectural and Information Flow Diagrams

## 1. High-Level Block Diagram

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Perception/Input Layer] --> B[Ethical Reasoning Engine]
    B --> C[Ethical Constraint Enforcement]
    C --> D[Action Selection/Execution]
    B --> E[Transparency & Explainability]
    D --> F[Monitoring & Feedback Loops]
    F --> B
    D --> G[Governance & Oversight]
    G --> B
    G --> F
    E --> G
```

**Explanation:**
- **Perception/Input Layer**: Receives environmental data, user commands, and system state.
- **Ethical Reasoning Engine**: Evaluates possible actions against the COMPASS directives.
- **Ethical Constraint Enforcement**: Filters out any actions violating hard constraints.
- **Action Selection/Execution**: Chooses and performs the best permissible action.
- **Transparency & Explainability**: Generates human-interpretable explanations for all decisions.
- **Monitoring & Feedback Loops**: Continuously tracks outcomes, system performance, and ethical adherence, feeding data back to the Reasoning Engine.
- **Governance & Oversight**: Human-in-the-loop review, audit, and override capabilities; can influence both reasoning and feedback.

## 2. Detailed Data Flow Diagram

```mermaid

    participant Env as Environment
    participant Per as Perception/Input
    participant RE as Ethical Reasoning Engine
    participant EC as Constraint Enforcement
    participant AS as Action Selector
    participant EX as Explainability
    participant MF as Monitoring/Feedback
    participant GOV as Governance/Oversight

    Env->>Per: Sensor data, user input, context
    Per->>RE: Structured observations
    RE->>EC: Candidate actions + ethical evaluation
    EC->>AS: Permitted actions
    AS->>EX: Selected action + rationale
    EX->>GOV: Explanation, logs
    AS->>Env: Execute action
    AS->>MF: Action outcome
    MF->>RE: Performance, ethical adherence metrics
    GOV->>RE: Policy updates, overrides
    GOV->>MF: Audit, feedback
```

## 5. Component Responsibilities Table

| Component                    | Responsibilities                                                                 |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Perception/Input              | Gather and preprocess all relevant data and context                              |
| Ethical Reasoning Engine      | Evaluate all possible actions against COMPASS directives                         |
| Ethical Constraint Enforcement| Block any action that violates non-negotiable ethical boundaries                 |
| Action Selection/Execution    | Select and execute the optimal action from the permitted set                     |
| Transparency & Explainability | Generate logs, rationales, and human-readable explanations for all decisions     |
| Monitoring & Feedback Loops   | Track outcomes, detect deviations, and provide data for continuous improvement   |
| Governance & Oversight        | Human review, policy updates, override, and audit of system behavior             |

## 6. Notes on Synchronization

- All components operate in a tightly coupled, real-time loop.
- Monitoring and Governance can trigger immediate adaptation or override at any stage.
- Transparency is maintained throughout, with every decision and action logged and explainable.
- Feedback from Monitoring and Governance is used to update reasoning policies and constraints dynamically.

**This architecture ensures that all parts of COMPASS work in harmony, supporting robust, auditable, and ethically aligned AI behavior.**
