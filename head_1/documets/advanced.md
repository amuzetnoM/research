# Advanced Usage Guide

This document covers advanced features and techniques for the AI Research Environment.

## Resource Management

### Memory Optimization

The environment includes automatic memory optimization based on available system resources:

- JVM heap size for Spark and other JVM-based tools
- Thread counts for numerical libraries (NumPy, MKL, etc.)
- GPU memory management for deep learning frameworks

### GPU Utilization

For optimal GPU utilization:

- Use mixed precision training when possible
- Monitor memory usage with the provided dashboards
- Consider gradient accumulation for larger models

## Error Handling Framework

The environment includes a robust error handling framework in the `utils.diagnostics` module:

- Exception classes specific to the research environment
- Comprehensive error logging and reporting
- Automatic diagnostic information collection
- Retry mechanism for transient errors

### Error Handling Best Practices

1. **Be Specific with Exception Types**: Catch specific exceptions rather than broad exception classes
2. **Provide Contextual Information**: Include relevant context in error messages
3. **Clean Up Resources**: Use `finally` blocks or context managers
4. **Log Before Raising**: Ensure errors are logged before propagating

## Extended Examples

### Robust Data Processing Pipeline

```python
from utils.diagnostics import retry, log_error

@retry(max_attempts=3, backoff_factor=2)
def load_dataset(path):
    """Load dataset with retry logic for network issues"""
    try:
        # Dataset loading code
        return dataset
    except (IOError, NetworkError) as e:
        log_error(f"Failed to load dataset from {path}", e)
        raise DatasetLoadError(f"Could not load {path}") from e
```

## Integration with External Tools

### Connecting to Remote Storage

```python
from utils.storage import secure_connection

with secure_connection('s3://my-bucket') as storage:
    data = storage.get('experiment_results.parquet')
```

### Distributed Computing

The environment supports distributed computing through:
- Dask for CPU-based distributed computing
- Horovod for distributed deep learning
- Ray for scalable ML workflows
