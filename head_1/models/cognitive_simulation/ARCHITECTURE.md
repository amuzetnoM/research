# Cognitive Simulation Architecture

This document provides a detailed technical description of the cognitive simulation architecture, explaining how the various components interact to create an effective testing environment for self-awareness capabilities.

## System Overview

The cognitive simulation implements a modular, extensible framework that simulates an artificial lifeform operating within a dynamic environment. The system is designed to demonstrate introspective cognitive abilities while providing rich data for analysis and visualization.

## Core Components

### 1. ArtificialLifeform

The central entity in the simulation, representing an agent with:

- **Energy Management**: Tracks and controls energy consumption/acquisition
- **Sensory Perception**: Gathers information from the environment through the SensorArray
- **Decision Making**: Selects actions based on sensory input and internal state
- **Learning Capabilities**: Adapts behavior based on performance and feedback

```python
class ArtificialLifeform:
    def __init__(self, initial_energy=100.0, name="Cognitron"):
        self.energy = initial_energy
        self.max_energy = initial_energy
        self.sensors = SensorArray()
        self.behaviors = BehaviorSystem()
        self.performance_metrics = {...}
        self.uncertainty_factors = {...}
        self.awareness = SelfAwarenessClient()
        
    def perceive_environment(self):
        """Gather sensory information from the environment"""
        
    def execute_behavior(self, action):
        """Perform behavioral routine based on selected action"""
        
    def evaluate_performance(self):
        """Calculate performance metrics based on current state"""
        
    def detect_uncertainty(self):
        """Identify uncertainty factors that may impact performance"""
        
    def adapt_to_insights(self):
        """Adapt behavior based on performance and uncertainty"""
```

#### 1.1 SensorArray

Manages the lifeform's sensory capabilities:

- Collects data from the environment with configurable reliability
- Handles multiple sensor types (energy, obstacle, reward, environment, internal)
- Applies sensor uncertainty to simulate real-world limitations

#### 1.2 BehaviorSystem

Implements the decision-making and action execution system:

- Uses a utility-based model for action selection
- Maintains weights for different behavior types
- Adapts behavior priorities based on performance and feedback
- Tracks action history for learning purposes

### 2. Environment

Simulates the external world in which the lifeform operates:

- **Dynamic Complexity**: Adjustable environmental complexity and stability
- **Obstacle Generation**: Creates challenges that the lifeform must navigate
- **Reward Distribution**: Provides opportunities for energy acquisition
- **Historical Tracking**: Records environmental state for analysis

```python
class Environment:
    def __init__(self, lifeform, complexity=0.5):
        self.lifeform = lifeform
        self.complexity = complexity
        self.obstacle_density = 0.3
        self.reward_density = 0.2
        self.environmental_stability = 0.7
        
    def update(self):
        """Simulate environmental changes and interactions"""
        
    def _update_environmental_conditions(self):
        """Update conditions with some randomness"""
        
    def _generate_obstacles(self):
        """Generate obstacles for the lifeform to avoid"""
        
    def _generate_rewards(self):
        """Generate rewards (energy sources) for the lifeform"""
```

### 3. SimulationManager

Orchestrates the overall simulation process:

- Coordinates the lifeform and environment interactions
- Manages simulation lifecycle (initialization, execution, termination)
- Collects and logs simulation data for later analysis
- Handles the connection to the self-awareness framework

```python
class SimulationManager:
    def __init__(self, lifeform, environment, log_directory="simulation_logs"):
        self.lifeform = lifeform
        self.environment = environment
        self.simulation_id = f"sim_{int(time.time())}"
        self.statistics = {...}
        
    def run_simulation(self, num_iterations=None):
        """Run the simulation for specified iterations or until stopped"""
        
    def _update_statistics(self):
        """Update simulation statistics"""
        
    def _log_simulation_state(self, final=False):
        """Log the current state of the simulation"""
```

## Analysis Components

### 1. SimulationVisualizer

Provides visualization capabilities for simulation results:

- Generates plots for energy levels, environment conditions, metrics, and behaviors
- Creates comprehensive summary reports of simulation outcomes
- Supports both interactive and file-based output formats

### 2. CognitiveAnalysis

Implements advanced analytical techniques for understanding the lifeform's behavior:

- **Survival Analysis**: Identifies factors contributing to longevity
- **Behavioral Pattern Analysis**: Examines adaptation and specialization
- **Environmental Impact Assessment**: Analyzes environmental effects on behavior
- **Cluster Analysis**: Uses machine learning to identify distinct operational modes
- **Learning Effectiveness Evaluation**: Measures adaptation rate and efficiency

```python
class CognitiveAnalysis:
    def __init__(self, log_directory="simulation_logs"):
        self.visualizer = SimulationVisualizer(log_directory)
        
    def analyze_survival_factors(self, df):
        """Analyze factors that contribute to survival"""
        
    def analyze_behavior_adaptation(self, df):
        """Analyze how behaviors adapt over time"""
        
    def analyze_environmental_impact(self, df):
        """Analyze how environment affects behavior and performance"""
        
    def perform_cluster_analysis(self, df, n_clusters=3):
        """Identify different operational modes"""
        
    def analyze_learning_effectiveness(self, df):
        """Analyze how effectively the lifeform learns and adapts"""
```

## Self-Awareness Integration

The cognitive simulation integrates with the Self-Awareness Framework:

### Connection and Registration

```python
# In ArtificialLifeform.__init__
self.awareness = SelfAwarenessClient()
self.awareness.add_insight_handler(self.handle_insight)
self.awareness.add_alert_handler(self.handle_alert)
```

### Metric Reporting

```python
# In ArtificialLifeform.update_energy_consumption
self.awareness.update_decision_metrics(
    confidence=1.0 - self.uncertainty_factors["action_outcome"],
    complexity=energy_consumed / 3.0,
    execution_time=0.1
)
```

### Insight Processing

```python
def handle_insight(self, insight_data):
    """Process insights received from the self-awareness framework"""
    if "resource_efficiency" in insight_data:
        efficiency = insight_data["resource_efficiency"]["score"]
        if efficiency < 50:
            # Adjust behavior based on efficiency insights
            self.behaviors.behavior_weights[ActionType.REST] *= 1.2
            self.behaviors.behavior_weights[ActionType.EXPLORE] *= 0.8
```

### Alert Handling

```python
def handle_alert(self, alert_data):
    """Handle alerts from the self-awareness framework"""
    if alert_data.get("category") == "resource" and "memory" in alert_data.get("message", ""):
        # Perform memory optimization when receiving memory alerts
        self.memory_optimization()
```

## Data Flow

1. The SimulationManager initializes the simulation components and begins execution
2. For each iteration:
   - The Environment updates its state (conditions, obstacles, rewards)
   - The ArtificialLifeform perceives the environment through its sensors
   - The BehaviorSystem selects an action based on utility calculations
   - The ArtificialLifeform executes the selected action
   - Performance metrics and uncertainty are evaluated
   - Data is logged for later analysis
3. The self-awareness framework provides insights and alerts based on metrics
4. The ArtificialLifeform adapts its behavior based on insights and performance
5. After simulation completion, the SimulationVisualizer and CognitiveAnalysis tools process the results

## Technical Design Considerations

### Scalability

- Modular design allows for extending sensor types, behavior options, and environmental elements
- Configurable logging frequency to manage disk usage during long simulations
- Memory optimization techniques to maintain performance

### Configurability

- JSON-based configuration system allows adjustment of parameters without code changes

- Sophisticated analytical tools using statistical and machine learning techniques

## Future Extensions
