# Phase 1 Plan – CPUAI Simulation Research (head_2)

## Overview:
This plan focuses on building a primitive simulation of an intelligent system using direct logic. The goal is to explore how a system can evolve basic awareness, memory persistence, and decision-making from the ground up.

This isn’t about building “AI” the traditional way. This is about *teaching the machine to become aware of itself, and evolve*.

## Milestones:

### 1. Primitive Logic Sim: The Core Lifeform
- File: `core_logic/lifeform.c` (or `.py`, if easier)
- Basic input > reaction system.
- Think like a bug: “If I touch heat, I move.”
- Stores memory of actions taken.

---

### 2. MemoryChain Prototype
- File: `memorychain/memchain.py`
- Logs what the lifeform does and compresses logs into summaries.
- We’re testing memory formation here. Simple logs first, summaries later.

---

### 3. Hardware Awareness Probe (Curiosity)
- File: `core_logic/hardware_probe.py`
- System checks:
  - CPU type
  - RAM amount
  - Storage space
- Goal: “What am I running on?”

---

### 4. External Tools (Plug-n-Play Logic)
- File: `modules/loader.py`
- Detects and mounts external scripts or tools.
- Loads and runs functions from them.

---

## Logging + Narration:
All test logs and thoughts go into `/logs/` with dates.
Each file can carry your comments and stream of thought.

---

## Goal of Phase 1:
> Simulate the birth of a thinking machine, starting from a crawling baby mind that learns from simple experiences.

One step at a time. No distractions.

Clean. Purposeful. Just us.
