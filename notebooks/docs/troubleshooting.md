# Troubleshooting Guide

This document provides solutions for common issues in the AI Research Environment.

## Integrated Diagnostic Tool

Run the comprehensive diagnostic tool:

```bash
python -m utils.diagnostic_tool
```

Or use the Python API:

```python
from utils.diagnostics import run_diagnostics
run_diagnostics()
```

## Common Issues

### Docker Issues

- **Container fails to start**: Verify Docker is running and you have sufficient permissions
- **Port conflicts**: Check if ports 8888, 6006, 3000, or 9090 are already in use
- **Resource limits**: Ensure Docker has sufficient CPU/memory allocation in Docker Desktop settings

### GPU Issues

- **GPU not detected**: Verify NVIDIA drivers are installed and `nvidia-smi` works
- **CUDA errors**: Check CUDA version compatibility with your libraries
- **Out of memory**: Reduce batch size or model size to fit in GPU memory

### Environment Manager Issues

- **Environment fails to start**: Check logs for specific error messages
- **Memory or CPU limits**: Adjust limits using `--mem-limit` and `--cpu-limit` options

### Resource Allocation

- **Out of memory errors**: Increase memory limit or reduce workload
- **Slow performance**: Check CPU/GPU utilization in monitoring dashboard

## Error Handling Best Practices

### 1. Be Specific with Exception Types

Catch specific exceptions rather than generic ones:

```python
try:
    # Operation that might fail
except SpecificError as e:
    # Handle this specific error
```

### 2. Clean Up Resources

Use context managers for resource cleanup:

```python
try:
    with open('output.txt', 'w') as file_handle:
        file_handle.write('Data')
except IOError as e:
    handle_exception("Failed to write to output file", e)
```

### 3. Log Before Raising

Log errors before re-raising them:

```python
try:
    # Operation
except SomeError as e:
    logger.error(f"Failed operation: {e}")
    raise
```

## Examining Error Reports

Error reports are saved in the `logs` directory with timestamps for debugging.
