# Self-Awareness Mechanics Framework

## Overview

The Self-Awareness Mechanics framework implements computational self-awareness for AI systems, enabling them to model their own capabilities, limitations, knowledge boundaries, and operational states.

This implementation is based on the research paper "Self-Awareness Mechanics in Artificial Intelligence Systems" and provides a concrete computational architecture for functional self-awareness.

## Architecture

The framework consists of five primary modules:

### 1. State Monitoring Module (SMM)

Collects real-time telemetry on system operations:
- CPU/GPU utilization
- Memory usage
- Processing latency
- I/O operations
- Custom metrics

```python
# Example: Accessing state data
state_data = framework.state_monitoring.state_data
memory_usage = state_data.get('memory_percent', 0)
```

### 2. Knowledge Modeling Module (KMM)

Maintains representations of system knowledge:
- Knowledge elements
- Confidence levels
- Knowledge sources
- Historical knowledge

```python
# Example: Adding knowledge
framework.knowledge_modeling.add_knowledge(
    'knowledge_key', 
    'knowledge_value',
    0.9,  # confidence
    'source_identifier'
)
```

### 3. Capability Assessment Module (CAM)

Models the system's abilities and limitations:
- Capability registry
- Performance metrics
- Resource requirements

```python
# Example: Registering a capability
framework.capability_assessment.register_capability(
    'capability_id',
    'Description of capability',
    {'cpu': 0.1, 'memory': 100 * 1024 * 1024}  # Resource requirements
)
```

### 4. Confidence Estimation Module (CEM)

Quantifies uncertainty across all predictions:
- Model uncertainty
- Calibration metrics
- Confidence history

```python
# Example: Estimating confidence
confidence = framework.confidence_estimation.estimate_confidence(
    inputs={'example_input': 'value'},
    prediction='predicted_value'
)
```

### 5. Regulatory Control Module (RCM)

Modifies system behavior based on self-awareness:
- Resource allocation
- Strategy selection
- Assistance requests

```python
# Example: Creating an assistance request
request = framework.regulatory_control.generate_assistance_request(
    issue="Resource constraint detected",
    severity=0.8,
    context={'memory_usage': 92}
)
```

## Self-Model

The self-model is a comprehensive representation of the system's understanding of itself, including:

- System metadata (ID, creation time)
- Current state information
- Knowledge boundaries
- Capability assessments
- Confidence levels
- Awareness metrics

The self-model can be retrieved, saved, and loaded:

```python
# Get current self-model
self_model = framework.get_self_model()

# Save to file
framework.save_self_model('/path/to/save/model.json')

# Load from file
framework.load_self_model('/path/to/load/model.json')
```

## Awareness Dimensions

The framework measures self-awareness across five dimensions:

1. **Introspective Awareness**: Knowledge of internal states and resources
2. **Capability Awareness**: Understanding of abilities and limitations
3. **Epistemic Awareness**: Modeling of knowledge and knowledge boundaries
4. **Temporal Awareness**: Awareness of past states and potential futures
5. **Social Awareness**: Understanding of relationship to other systems and humans

Each dimension has associated metrics that can be tracked and visualized.

## Integration with Other Systems

The Self-Awareness Mechanics framework is designed for easy integration with other systems:

### Monitoring Infrastructure

Integrates with Prometheus and Grafana:
```python
# Enable Prometheus metrics
framework.enable_prometheus_metrics(port=8000)
```

### Container Environment

Supports Docker/Kubernetes environments:
```python
# Configure for container environment
framework = SelfAwarenessFramework({
    'container_id': 'research_container_1'
})
```

### Visualization Tools

Comprehensive visualization tools are available in the notebooks directory:
- Knowledge graph visualization
- Capability boundary explorer
- Confidence visualization
- Temporal evolution tracker
- Anomaly detection dashboard

## Performance Considerations

- The full framework increases computational overhead by 15-30%
- For resource-constrained environments, use the `lite` configuration:
  ```python
  framework = SelfAwarenessFramework({'mode': 'lite'})
  ```
- Consider reducing the monitoring sampling rate for lower overhead:
  ```python
  framework = SelfAwarenessFramework({'monitoring_rate': 0.2})  # 5-second intervals
  ```
